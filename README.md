# Tailscale-Connected Network for PLC Communication, Monitoring and Support 
Design to use Tailscale to connect an automation PLC running on Linux to application servers residing in a remote data center data center

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to securely connect an industrial automation PLC running on Linux to remote application servers using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), a mesh VPN built on WireGuard. The goal is to enable seamless, encrypted communication between edge devices and centralized infrastructure‚Äîideal for reote access (support), remote monitoring, and automation control systems via APIs.

## Why Tailscale?
- üîê Zero-config VPN with automatic key rotation
- üåç Works across NATs and firewalls without port forwarding
- üß† Ideal for edge-to-cloud architectures in industrial environments

## Architecture
- **Edge Node**: Linux-based PLC
- **Application Server**: Linux based remote moitoring
- **API Server**: Linux based controls via APIs
- **Remote Access**: Windows Laptop for remote access
- **VPN Layer**: Tailscale mesh network
- **Communication Protocols**: HTTP/HTTPS, Modbus/TCP, REST APIs, SSH

## Use Cases
- Remote diagnostics and firmware updates
- Secure telemetry streaming from PLC to cloud
- Real-time control commands from centralized dashboards

## Assumptions
1) You already have a Tailscale account with "Admin" access
2) The application server has KVM configured
3) Port forwarding is previously configured for VM connectivity
4) Host networks provide at minimum the following access:
   - inside devices any --> TCP 443 (SSL)
   - inside devices UDP 41641 (wireguard tunnel)--> Any
   - inside devices UDP 3478 (STUN) --> Any
   - inside devices TCP 80 (HTTP) --> Any

## Deployment Steps (Suggested order)
1) Install and Configure Tailscale on the KVM server - See file "KVM-Server" 
2) Install and Configure Tailscale on the Linux PLC - See file "Linux-PLC" 
3) Configure the KVM server for Subnet Routing and advertise routed for VMs - See file "KVM-Server-Subnet-Routing" 
4) Install and Configure Tailscale on Windows PV for remote access - See file "Windows-PC"
5) (optional) Install and Deploy Tailscale/Prometheus/Grafana on Linux w/cockpit for advanced monitoring - base scripts "matt-tailnet.sh and matt-tailnet.yaml) 

## Future Enhancements
- Develop Terraform scripts to simplify deployment for thousands of PLC servers
- Improve integration with Grafana for telemetry visualization (base ansible and bash scripts)
- Role-based access control via Tailscale ACLs
- Optional integration with identity providers (Google, Microsoft, Okta)
