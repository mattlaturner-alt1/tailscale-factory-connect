To deploy your **Matt-Tailnet** stack with Ansible, a step-by-step guide that gets everything running on your bare-metal or cloud Linux servers:

---

## Step-by-Step: Deploy Matt-Tailnet with Ansible

### 1. **Install Ansible (on your control machine)**

If you're running Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ansible
```

Or use `pip`:

```bash
pip install ansible
```

---

### 2. **Create Your Project Structure**

```bash
mkdir matt-tailnet
cd matt-tailnet
touch matt_tailnet.yml inventory.ini
```

---

### 3. **Define Your Inventory**

Edit `inventory.ini` to list your target servers:

```ini
[tailnet]
192.168.1.101 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
192.168.1.102 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

You can name the group anything (`[tailnet]` here), and include as many hosts as needed.

---

### 4. **Save the Playbook**

Paste the full `matt_tailnet.yml` playbook (from earlier) into your project folder. This playbook installs:

- Cockpit
- Tailscale with subnet routing
- Prometheus Node Exporter
- Grafana with auto-imported dashboard

Make sure to replace the `tailscale_auth_key` and subnet with your actual values.

---

### 5. **Run the Playbook**

From the `matt-tailnet` directory:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini matt_tailnet.yml --ask-become-pass
```

- `--ask-become-pass` prompts for `sudo` password if needed
- You can also use `--limit` to target specific hosts

---

### 6. **Verify Deployment**

After it runs, check:

- `https://<host>:9090` → Cockpit
- `http://<host>:3000` → Grafana (admin/admin)
- `http://<host>:9100` → Node Exporter
- `tailscale status` → Mesh connectivity
